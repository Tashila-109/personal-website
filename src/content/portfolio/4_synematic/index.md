The food industry was the main aim first, where 3D modelling of a food item was done and was showcased using Web AR. This is the landing page for Synematic LK, styled using bootstrap 4 and sass. The backend is written with Node Js, and the Three Js Library is used to render the 3D models on the webpage.
